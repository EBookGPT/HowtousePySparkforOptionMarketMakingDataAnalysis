# Chapter 10: Advanced Options Pricing Analysis using PySpark 

Welcome back, dear reader! In our previous chapter, we learned how to perform Time Series Analysis on Option Market Making data using PySpark. In this chapter, we will take a step further and explore Advanced Options Pricing Analysis using PySpark.

Options Pricing is a key area in Option Market Making as it helps market makers determine the fair value of an option and derive profitable trading strategies. With increasing volumes of data being generated each day, analyzing these data sets has become increasingly complex, requiring modern big data tools like PySpark to process and analyze these data sets efficiently.

In this chapter, we are privileged to have the special guest Nassim Nicholas Taleb, an expert in options pricing and the author of the best seller book "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable". He will share his experience and knowledge on advanced options pricing analysis using PySpark, and guide us through various advanced pricing models and techniques that can be implemented using PySpark.

We will cover various advanced pricing models such as Black-Scholes, Binomial Model, and Monte Carlo Simulation. Furthermore, we will look at techniques such as Volatility Smile, Volatility Skew, and Greeks, and explore how these techniques can be implemented using PySpark.

Throughout this chapter, we will use real-world data sets and implement various pricing models and techniques using PySpark. We will provide detailed code samples and explain how these models and techniques can be implemented in a distributed environment using PySpark.

We hope that by the end of this chapter, you will have a broad understanding of advanced options pricing analysis techniques and how to implement these techniques using PySpark. So, sit tight and let's take the first step towards mastering advanced options pricing analysis!

Now, without further ado, let's welcome our special guest, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and dive deeper into Advanced Options Pricing Analysis using PySpark.

So, gear up to master Advanced Options Pricing Analysis using PySpark, and let's welcome our expert guest, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, for this enriching learning experience!
Sure, let me explain the code we will be using to resolve the exercises in this chapter.

In this chapter, we will be using PySpark, which is a powerful open-source big data processing framework that allows us to efficiently process and analyze large data sets in a distributed environment.

We will be running our code using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive web-based tool that allows us to write and execute code, as well as visualize data.

For each exercise, we will be providing a detailed explanation of the code, along with code examples, that will help you understand the concept better. Additionally, we will be using real-world data sets to demonstrate the practical applications of these models and techniques.

Here is an example of the code we will be using to implement a Monte Carlo Simulation of Options Pricing:

```
# import libraries
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType

# create Spark session
conf = SparkConf().setAppName("MonteCarloSimulation")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
spark = SparkSession(sc)

# define pricing function
def monte_carlo_simulation(option_type, spot_price, strike_price, time_to_expiry, risk_free_rate, volatility):
    # simulate 10,000 scenarios
    num_simulations = 10000

    # set time and interval
    time_interval = 1.0 / 252.0   # assuming 252 trading days in a year
    time_periods = int(round(time_to_expiry / time_interval))

    # define relevant variables
    daily_return = (risk_free_rate - 0.5 * volatility ** 2) * time_interval
    daily_volatility = volatility * time_interval ** 0.5
    option_price = 0

    # simulate stock price for each scenario
    for x in range(num_simulations):
        stock_price = spot_price
        for y in range(time_periods):
            stock_price = stock_price * (1 + daily_return + daily_volatility * np.random.normal())

        # calculate payoff of the option and aggregate
        if option_type == 'call':
            payoff = max(stock_price - strike_price, 0)
        else:
            payoff = max(strike_price - stock_price, 0)

        option_price += payoff

    # calculate average of the payoffs and discount to present value
    avg_payoff = option_price / num_simulations
    present_value = avg_payoff * np.exp(-risk_free_rate * time_to_expiry)

    return present_value

# register function as a UDF
monte_carlo_udf = udf(monte_carlo_simulation, DoubleType())

# apply function to dataframe
simulated_data = option_data.withColumn('option_price', monte_carlo_udf(option_data.option_type, option_data.spot_price, option_data.strike_price, option_data.time_to_expiry, option_data.risk_free_rate, option_data.volatility))
```

This code performs a Monte Carlo Simulation of Options Pricing using PySpark. We use PySpark SQL to load the data and define a pricing function to simulate the stock price for each scenario, calculate the payoff of the option, and aggregate the results. Finally, we apply the function to a dataframe and calculate the average payoff of the option, discount it to its present value, and return the final fair value of the option.

We hope this explanation helps you understand the code we will be using in this chapter. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
