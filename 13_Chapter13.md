# Chapter 13: Sensitivity Analysis for Option Market Making using PySpark

Welcome back to our book on How to use PySpark for Option Market Making Data Analysis! In the previous chapter, we discussed how to implement Delta Neutral Option Trading Strategies using PySpark. We hope you gained valuable insights and found the content helpful in your trading endeavors.

In this chapter, we will dive into Sensitivity Analysis for Option Market Making using PySpark. Sensitivity analysis is a technique that is widely used by traders to identify how much the output of a strategy changes with a change in the input parameters. PySpark, with its robust distributed processing capabilities, comes in handy when dealing with large datasets and complex computations. We will show you how to perform Sensitivity Analysis using PySpark, and how to interpret the results to improve your trading strategy.

We are delighted to have Nassim Nicholas Taleb, renowned philosopher and trader, as a special guest for this chapter. His extensive work on option pricing, risk management, and the black swan theory has greatly influenced the financial industry. He will provide additional insights into Sensitivity Analysis and share his experiences with us.

So, buckle up and let's begin our journey into Sensitivity Analysis for Option Market Making using PySpark!

We are pleased to have special guest Nassim Nicholas Taleb with us for this chapter. Nassim's work on option pricing, risk management, and the black swan theory has greatly influenced the financial industry. His insights into Sensitivity Analysis and experience with trading will provide valuable perspectives.

In this chapter, we will cover the following areas:

- Understanding Sensitivity Analysis in Option Market Making
- Implementation of Sensitivity Analysis using PySpark
- Interpretation of results and impact on trading strategy
- Insights from guest contributor Nassim Nicholas Taleb

With the combination of our expertise and the insights provided by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, we are excited to present this chapter on Sensitivity Analysis for Option Market Making using PySpark. Let's get started!
Certainly! In this section, I will explain the code used to perform Sensitivity Analysis for Option Market Making using PySpark. 

To perform sensitivity analysis, we need to calculate the partial derivatives of the option greeks with respect to the input parameters. This requires computing the option greeks for a range of input parameter values, which can become computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets. PySpark's distributed processing capabilities can significantly improve the speed of computation in such scenarios. 

Here's a sample code that demonstrates the implementation of Sensitivity Analysis using PySpark:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Define the input parameter range
min_param = 0.1
max_param = 0.9
param_step = 0.1
input_param_range = [i for i in range(min_param,max_param+param_step,param_step)]

# Load the option market making data into a Spark dataframe
option_data = spark.read.csv('option_data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Define a UDF to compute the option price and greeks
@udf(returnType=DoubleType())
def compute_option_price_and_greeks(S, K, r, T, sigma, option_type):
  # Compute the option price and greeks using Black-Scholes formula
  # ...
  return [option_price, delta, gamma, theta, vega]

# Compute option greeks for each input parameter value using Window functions
analytic_funcs = ["delta", "gamma", "theta", "vega"]
for func in analytic_funcs:
    for i in range(len(input_param_range)):
        current_param = input_param_range[i]
        next_param = input_param_range[i+1] if i+1<len(input_param_range) else input_param_range[i]
        window = Window.partitionBy('option_type').orderBy('S')
        option_data = option_data.withColumn(func+str(current_param), 
                                (col(func+str(next_param)) - col(func+str(current_param))) / param_step)
      
# Save the computed greeks to a new dataframe
computed_greeks = option_data.select('S', 'K', 'r', 'T', 'position_type', 'option_type', *[func+str(p) for func in analytic_funcs for p in input_param_range])
```

In the above code, we first define the range of input parameters for which we want to compute the option greeks. We then load the option market making data into a Spark dataframe, and define a UDF to compute the option price and greeks. Using window functions, we compute the greeks for each input parameter value, and save the computed greeks to a new dataframe. 

This is just a sample code, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of your trading strategy. I hope this explanation helps you understand how to apply Sensitivity Analysis to Option Market Making data using PySpark.
