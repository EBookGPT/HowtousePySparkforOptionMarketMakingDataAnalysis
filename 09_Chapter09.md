# Chapter 9: Time Series Analysis of Option Market Making Data using PySpark

In the previous chapter, we learned how to visualize option market making data using Matplotlib and PySpark DataFrame. We saw how we can use various plot types to understand the trends and patterns that exist within the data. In this chapter, we will take our analysis to the next level and dive deeper into understanding the data by performing time series analysis.

Time series analysis is an important tool for understanding data that varies over time. Financial data is an excellent example of this type of data, as stock prices, exchange rates, and option prices all change continuously over time. By using PySpark's time series analysis tools, we can analyze this data to extract meaningful insights and make better-informed decisions.

In this chapter, we will focus on using PySpark to perform time series analysis specifically on option market making data. We will cover topics such as time series decomposition, smoothing, and forecasting. We will also learn how to identify patterns in the data and how to make predictions based on those patterns.

As with the previous chapter, we will once again use PySpark DataFrame to load and manipulate the data. We will also introduce PySpark's time series libraries, such as TimeSeriesRDD, that are specifically designed for these types of analyses. By the end of this chapter, you will have the knowledge and skills to perform advanced time series analysis of option market making data using PySpark.
# Chapter 9: Time Series Analysis of Option Market Making Data using PySpark

## Introduction
Financial data is characterized by constant variation over time, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights from raw data. In this chapter, we will explore the use of time series analysis using PySpark DataFrame to analyze option market making data. Time series analysis is a vital technique for understanding how data changes over time. It can help organizations identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that exist within the data, allowing for more precise and informed decision-making.

## Objectives
In this chapter, we will cover the following subjects:

* Time series decomposition: This technique decomposes the data into its underlying components. It helps understand how the data behaves over time, enabling better pattern identification.
* Smoothing: Here, we will look at techniques for reducing the noise in the data, such as moving averages, exponential smoothing, and more.
* Forecasting: We will explore forecasting models such as ARIMA and SARIMA to make predictions about future data values.
* Identifying patterns: We will discuss methods for identifying patterns in the data, such as autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and more.
* PySpark Time Series Libraries: We will introduce PySpark's time series libraries, such as TimeSeriesRDD, that are specifically designed for working with financial data.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this chapter, you should have a basic understanding of PySpark DataFrame and data visualization techniques such as Matplotlib. Knowledge of option market making data is also beneficial.

## Conclusion
By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of time series analysis techniques and how to apply them to option market making data using PySpark. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to extract actionable insights from the data, which will enable more informed decision-making in the financial industry.
The time series analysis of option market making data requires the implementation of several techniques, including time series decomposition, smoothing, and forecasting. In this section, we will see how to implement a basic time series analysis in PySpark using an example of option market making data.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.types import *
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

## load data
option_df = spark.read.format('csv').load('option_data.csv', inferSchema=True, header=True)

## convert timestamp column to date type
option_df = option_df.withColumn('Time', from_unixtime('Time').cast(DateType()))

## add new column to dataframe with difference in option price
option_df = option_df.withColumn('Diff', option_df['OptionPrice'] - lag(option_df['OptionPrice'], 1).over(Window.partitionBy('Symbol').orderBy('Time')))

## drop null values
option_df = option_df.na.drop()

## set feature columns and output column
feature_cols = ['Time', 'OpenInterest', 'ImpVolatility']
output_col = 'Diff'

## create Vector Assembler for feature columns
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol='features')

## transform data to feature vectors
dataset = assembler.transform(option_df)

## split data into training and test sets
(trainingData, testData) = dataset.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3])

## create random forest regressor model
rf = RandomForestRegressor(featuresCol='features', labelCol=output_col)

## train model on training data
model = rf.fit(trainingData)

## make predictions on test data
predictions = model.transform(testData)

## evaluate model performance
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol=output_col, predictionCol='prediction', metricName='rmse')
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on test data: {rmse}')
```

In the above code, we first load the option market making data from a CSV file and convert the timestamp column to the date format. Next, we compute the difference in option price for each option based on the previous value. We then drop any null values from the resulting dataframe.

Next, we specify the feature columns and output column used to train the random forest regressor model. We use a vector assembler to transform the data to feature vectors. We then split the dataset into training and test sets.

We create a random forest regressor model and train it on the training data. We make predictions using the trained model on the test data and evaluate the model's performance using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. The code outputs the RMSE on the test data.

This code is a simple implementation of time series analysis using PySpark. You can explore more advanced techniques for time series analysis such as smoothing and forecasting to gain deeper insights into the data.
